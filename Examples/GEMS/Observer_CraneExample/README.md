EMBOCON GEMS Crane Example - ObserverInterface Dummy Library Implementation
========================================================================

The ObserverInterface Dummy Library Implementation includes the a basic ObserverInterface implementation for the crane example of the EMBOCON project. All basic functions return the appropriate values. This library is required to setup and test the crane example with GEMS.

The main function call of the observer interface is the makeObsStep() function call in which the plant (or simulation) measurements are translated to state estimates.
