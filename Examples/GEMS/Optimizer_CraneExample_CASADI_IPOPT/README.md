EMBOCON GEMS Crane Example - OptimizerInterface CasADi and IPOPT Library Implementation
=======================================================================================

The OptimizerInterface CasADi and IPOPT Library Implementation includes the a OptimizerInterface implementation for the crane example of the EMBOCON project using CasADi and IPOPT. Both packages are required to be installed on the system. The dynamic model of the crane example is encoded into the optimizer codes of CasADi and IPOPT. Additional files in the exclude folder are required to provide tightening bounds to the IPOPT solver. This library is one of the three available OptimizerInterface implementations required to setup and test the crane example with GEMS.
