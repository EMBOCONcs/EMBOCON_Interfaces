EMBOCON GEMS Crane Example - SimulationApplicationInterface SUNDIALS Library Implementation
===========================================================================================

The SimulationApplicationInterface SUNDIALS Library Implementation includes the a SimulationApplicationInterface implementation for the crane example of the EMBOCON project using the open-source integrator package [SUNDIALS](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html). The SUNDIALS package is required to be installed on the system. The simulation contains the dynamic model of the crane example. This library is required to setup and test the crane example with GEMS.
